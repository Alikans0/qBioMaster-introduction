# Introduction to quantitative biology



## Summary

Provide a broad overview on emerging quantitative interdisciplinary fields in biosciences, ranging from experimental state-of-the-art techniques in microscopy, synthetic biology and systemic approaches to life sciences.

## Topics

"Projects" denotes a topic that could be tackled on the programming, imaging and synbio angle. Some of them could be done by student groups after an introduction from the teacher.

There will be optional and **compulsory** projects. The **compulsory** projects will be those that are required for later stages in this module or on other subsequent modules.

Projects in these UE will not be experimental.

- Introduction to networks in biology

- Transcription networks and gene regulation

    - Project: stochasticity in biology, random walks,  
    - Project: Observing gene expression (single molecule/cell vs population)
    - Project: Negative Feedback
    - Project: Bistability and Memory (intro to biocomputing)
    
- **Basics of microscopy**
- **Project: Basics of microscopy**: lenses, focal points, magnifications, lasers
    - **Project: basic processing of images in Python**
- Project: Imaging single molecules (on a surface). Single-molecule detection/ super-resolution microscopy
    - Project: Imaging single molecule dynamics in plant roots ()
- Project: Measuring protein dynamics in vitro and in vivo (FCS/ FRAP)
    - Project: Imaging Spatial patterning in Drosophila (volumetric 3D, 2P?)

- Processing biological datasets (Big data in Biology)
  
    - Project: *detect chipSeq peaks and classify. Something about exploring sequenced genomes and look for promoters, make logo plots, etc etc* 
    - Project: segmenting PSF using astropy
    - Project: segmenting DAPI masks using stardist
    - Project: constructing trajectories from single molecule localizations
    
- Key concepts in biology: 

  - Robustness
    - Project: Kinetics proofreading
    - Project: Bacterial chemotaxis
    - Project: Spatial patterning in development ? (Drosophila)
  - Optimality
  - Project: Genetic design

## Teachers

- Luca Ciandrini
- Marcelo Nollmann / Antoine Le Gall
- Luca/PEM
- Francesco / Ashley
- I would keep the number pretty small anyway
