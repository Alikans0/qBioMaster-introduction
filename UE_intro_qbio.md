# Introduction to quantitative biology



## Summary

Provide a broad overview on emerging quantitative interdisciplinary fields in biosciences, ranging from experimental state-of-the-art techniques in microscopy, synthetic biology and systemic approaches to life sciences.

## Topics

"Projects" denotes a topic that could be tackled on the programming, imaging and synbio angle. Some of them could be done by student groups after an introduction from the teacher. **Bold** projects are compulsory for everyone. 


- Introduction to networks in biology
    - Key concepts in biology: Robustness 
    - Key concepts in biology: Optimality
These concepts need to be highlighted in each theme below.

- Stochasticity in biology, random walks
    - **Project**: Basics of microscopy: lenses, focal points, magnifications, lasers [ Marcelo ]
    - **Project**: basic processing of images in Python
    - Project: constructing trajectories from single molecule localizations (here or in The Genome)

- Transcription networks and gene regulation
    - **Project**: Observing gene expression (single molecule/cell vs population)
    - Project: Negative Feedback
    - Project: Bistability and Memory (intro to biocomputing)
    - Project: Imaging Spatial patterning in development - Drosophila (volumetric 3D, 2P?)
    - Project: Measuring protein dynamics in vitro and in vivo (FCS/ FRAP)
    - Project: Kinetics proofreading
    
- The Genome
    - **Project**: Basics of genome-wide data processing, exploring sequenced genomes and look for promoters, make logo plots, etc etc
    - Project: detect chipSeq peaks and classify.
    - Project: segmenting PSF using astropy
    - Project: segmenting DAPI masks using stardist
    - Project: Genetic design
    
- Membrane biophyics
    - Project: Imaging single molecules (on a surface). Single-molecule detection/ super-resolution microscopy
    - Project: Imaging single molecule dynamics in plant roots ()
    - Project: Bacterial chemotaxis
