# Introduction to quantitative biology



## Summary

Provide a broad overview on emerging quantitative interdisciplinary fields in biosciences, ranging from experimental state-of-the-art techniques in microscopy, synthetic biology and systemic approaches to life science.

## Topics

"Projects" denotes a topic that could be tackled on the programming, imaging and synbio angle. Some of them could be done by student groups after an introduction from the teacher.

- Introduction on networks in biology
- Transcription networks and gene regulation

    - Project: stochasticity in biology 
    - Project: Observing gene expression (single molecule/cell vs population)
    - Project: Negative Feedback
    - Project: Bistability and Memory (intro to biocomputing)
- Large biological dataset (Big data in Biology)
    - Project: *need to find an application. Something about exploring sequenced genomes and look for promoters, make logo plots, etc etc* 
- Key concepts in biology: 

  - Robustness
    - Project: Kinetics proofreading
    - Project: Bacterial chemotaxis
    - Project: Spatial patterning in development ? (Drosophila)
  - Optimality
  - Project: Genetic design

## Teachers

- Luca Ciandrini
- Marcelo Nollman
- ? More ? I would keep the number pretty small anyway
