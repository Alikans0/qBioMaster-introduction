# Introduction to quantitative biology



## Summary

Provide a broad overview on emerging quantitative interdisciplinary fields in biosciences, ranging from experimental state-of-the-art techniques in microscopy, synthetic biology and systemic approaches to life sciences.

## Topics

"Projects" denotes a topic that could be tackled on the programming, imaging and synbio angle. Some of them could be done by student groups after an introduction from the teacher. **Bold** projects are compulsory for everyone. 

There will be *optional* and **compulsory** projects. The **compulsory** projects will be those that are required for later stages in this module or for other subsequent modules.

Projects in these UE will not be experimental.

- Introduction to networks in biology
    - **Robustness**
    - **Optimality**
	These concepts need to be highlighted in each theme below.

- Basics of microscopy
	- **lenses, focal points, aperture, magnification, etc**
	- **imaging systems: widefield, confocal, etc**
	- **Diffraction, interference, diffraction barrier**
	Projects:
		- **Project: Basics of microscopy**: simulating ray tracing
		- **Project: basic image processing in Python**
		- Project: Simulating interference patterns

- Transcription networks and gene regulation
	- **Stochasticity in biology, random walks**
    - **Project**: Observing gene expression (single molecule/cell vs population)
    - Project: Negative Feedback
    - Project: Bistability and Memory (intro to biocomputing)
    - Project: Imaging Spatial patterning in development - Drosophila (volumetric 3D, 2P?)
    - Project: Measuring protein dynamics in vitro and in vivo (FCS/ FRAP)
    - Project: Kinetic proofreading

- Genome Biophysics
	- **DNA structure**
	- **epigenetics**
	- **modeling DNA**
	- **cis-regulatory elements**
	Projects:
	    - **Project**: Basics of genome-wide data processing, exploring sequenced genomes and look for promoters, make logo plots, etc etc
		- Project: Genetic design
		- Project: detect chipSeq peaks and classify.
		- Project: Reconstructing trajectories from single molecule localizations of ParB
		- Project: Imaging Spatial patterning in Drosophila (volumetric 3D, 2P?)
		- Project: segmenting PSF using astropy
		- Project: segmenting DAPI masks using stardist

- Membrane Biophysics
	- **jdskjdb**
	- **jdskjdb**
	Projects:
