# Introduction to quantitative biology



## Summary

Provide a broad overview on emerging quantitative interdisciplinary fields in biosciences, ranging from experimental state-of-the-art techniques in microscopy, synthetic biology and systemic approaches to life sciences.



## Topics

"Projects" denotes a topic that could be tackled on the programming, imaging and synbio angle. Some of them could be done by student groups after an introduction from the teacher. **Bold** projects are compulsory for everyone. 

There will be *optional* and **compulsory** projects. The **compulsory** projects will be those that are required for later stages in this module or for other subsequent modules.

Projects in these UE will not be experimental.



0. *Introduction:* Quantitative Biology as an inter- and multi-disciplinary meeting point of disciplines to analyse, integrate and construct complex biological behaviours.



1. *Key concepts in biology*:
- **Robustness**   
- **Optimality**

The concepts of Robustness and Optimality will be emphasised in each theme below.



2. *Random walks and stochasticity in Biology*. We will first give an overview of the theory and some biological examples. We will use these examples to introduce the **basics of microscopy**:
- **lenses, focal points, aperture, magnification, etc**
- **imaging systems: widefield, confocal, etc**
- **Diffraction, interference, diffraction barrier**
Projects:
	- ***Project: Basics of microscopy**: simulating ray tracing
	
	- ***Project: basic image processing in Python**
	
	- Project: Simulating interference patterns



3. *Introduction to biological networks*. Broad overview.

   

4. *Transcription networks and gene regulation*. 

- ***Project**: Measuring gene expression (single molecule/cell vs population)
- ***Project**: Basics of genome-wide data processing, exploring sequenced genomes and look for promoters, make logo plots, etc etc
- Project: Negative Feedback
- Project: Bistability and Memory (intro to biocomputing)
- Project: Imaging Spatial patterning in development - Drosophila (volumetric 3D, 2P?)
- Project: Measuring protein dynamics in vitro and in vivo (FCS/ FRAP)
- Project: Kinetic proofreading



5. *Genome Biophysics*

- **DNA structure**

- **epigenetics**

- **modeling DNA**

- **cis-regulatory elements**

  Projects:

  - Project: Genetic design
  - Project: detect chipSeq peaks and classify.
  - Project: Reconstructing trajectories from single molecule localizations of ParB
  - Project: Imaging Spatial patterning I slackn Drosophila (volumetric 3D, 2P?)
  - Project: segmenting PSF using astropy
  - Project: segmenting DAPI masks using stardist



6. Membrane Biophysics

- **Life in 2D: structure and function**
- **To be decided**: Basics of AFM? 
Projects:
    - Project: Imaging single molecule dynamics in plant roots
    - Project: Bacterial chemotaxis
	- Project: Something about lipid rafts?
	



## Teachers

- Luca Ciandrini
- Marcelo Nollmann
- PEM?



## Evaluation

Mixed evaluation between project (compulsory 4*10% + chosen 10%) + CC (20%) + final exam (30%).
