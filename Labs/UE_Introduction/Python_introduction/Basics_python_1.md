Workshop topics

## Python Installation and Understanding Packages

Many websites provide hands-on instructions to setup up your environment to work with python. This will show you how to install python and packages. Resources:

- [python4astronomers](https://python4astronomers.github.io/installation/python_install.html)


## Core packages

- [Numpy](Introduction_NumPy.md)
- [Matplotlib](Introduction_Matplotlib.md)
- [Reading and writing files](https://python4astronomers.github.io/files/files.html)
- [Fitting data using Sherpa](https://python4astronomers.github.io/fitting/fitting.html)
- Fitting data using Scipy: 
  - [Scipy](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/scipy/auto_examples/plot_curve_fit.html)
  - [MOLssi](https://education.molssi.org/python-data-analysis/03-data-fitting/index.html) 



## Jupyter Notebooks

See the excellent introduction on jupyter notebooks from Volker Baecker [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/python_in_an_hour/blob/master/PIAH_01_jupyter.ipynb).

Otherwise, follow the clone of this lab in your local jupyter lab by opening [PIAH_01_jupyter.ipynb](PIAH_01_jupyter.ipynb).
